NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree as follows:

1. **SERVICES**

1.1 **Statements of Work.** From time to time, Client and Contractor may execute one or more statement(s) of work, substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A, detailing the specific services to be performed by Contractor (as executed, a **“Statement of Work”**). Each  Statement  of  Work  will  expressly  refer  to  this  Agreement,  will  form  a  part  of  this Agreement, and will be subject to the terms and conditions contained herein. A Statement of  Work  may  be  amended  only  by  a  signed  (by  each  party’s  authorized  signatory)  and written agreement of the parties.

1.2 **Performance  of  Services.**  Contractor  will  perform  the  services  described  in  each Statement of Work (the **“Services”**) in accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in each Statement of Work and this Agreement.

**It is the express intention of the Client and Contractor that Contractor performs the services as an independent contractor for the Client.**  Contractor  represents,  warrants, and agrees that Contractor acknowledges and agrees that Contractor is obligated to report as  income  all  compensation  received  by  Contractor  pursuant  to  this  Agreement  and specifically agrees to provide the Client with a taxpayer identification number used by the Contractor’s  business.  Contractor  agrees  that  Contractor  meets  all  tests  set  forth  by applicable  law  with  respect  to  his/her  independent  contractor  status,  including  but  not limited to the “ABC” test under California Labor Code Sections 2750.3 and 3351, as well as under  the  California  Unemployment  Insurance  Code  Sections  606.5  and  621  and/or  AB 2257 as well as any other similar local, state, and/or federal laws that may be applicable to Contractor’s independent contractor status.

Contractor will determine, in Contractor’s sole discretion, the manner and means by which the Services are accomplished, subject to the requirement that Contractor will at all times comply with applicable law and any compliance policies drawn to Contractors’ attention insofar as they are applicable to independent contractors.

1.3 **Equipment  and  Facilities.**  Unless  otherwise  provided  in  a  Statement  of  Work, Contractor will perform the Services at Contractor’s offices, place of business, or any other location  of  Contractor’s  choosing,  using  Contractor’s  instruments,  equipment  and  tools. Contractor will determine the time, place and order in which Contractor will perform the Services  in  accordance  with  any  milestones  and/or  timeline  set  forth  in  a  Statement  of Work.

1.4 **Subcontractors.** Contractor may appoint a suitably skilled substitute in replacement of the  initial  personnel  and  shall  be  entitled  to  subcontract  the  performance  of  the Consultancy Services, provided that Client provides written consent after being adequately satisfied that the sub-contractor possesses the necessary skills, expertise and resources to perform  those  elements  of  the  Services  and  that  Contractor  ensures  the  substitute  or subcontractor will abide by the same obligations Contractor is subject to under the terms of this Agreement regarding confidentiality, intellectual property, data protection, anti-bribery, anti-corruption, anti-tax avoidance; if so required by Client, Contractor will ensure that the subcontractor or substitute enters into direct undertakings with Contractor regarding these obligations. Contractor will continue to be bound by all the obligations in this Agreement and  will  invoice  Client  and  be  responsible  for  the  remuneration  of  the  substitute  or subcontractor.  Contractor  will  keep  Client  fully  and  effectively  indemnified  against  any reasonable costs, claims or expenses that may be incurred by it as a result of the use of such subcontractors including the reasonable cost of all instruction (necessitated by the subcontracting) for the sub-contractor.

2. **PAYMENT**
 
2.1 **Fees.** As Contractor’s sole compensation for the performance of Services, Client will pay Contractor the fees specified in each Statement of Work in accordance with the terms set forth  therein.  Contractor  acknowledges  and  agrees  that,  if  specified  in  a  Statement  of Work, Client’s payment obligation will be expressly subject to Contractor’s completion of Services  provided  therein  or  achievement  of  certain  milestones  to  Client’s  reasonable satisfaction.

2.2 **Expenses.** Unless otherwise provided in the Statement of Work, Client will reimburse Contractor for reasonable travel and related expenses incurred in the course of performing the Services hereunder, provided, however, that any such expenses will be approved in advance in writing by an authorized representative of Client. As a condition to receipt of reimbursement,  Contractor  will  submit  to  Client  reasonable  evidence  that  the  amount involved  was  both  reasonable  and  necessary  to  the  Services  provided  under  this Agreement.

2.3 **Payment Terms.** The payment terms will be set forth in the Statement of Work. The parties will use their respective commercially reasonable efforts to promptly resolve any payment disputes.

2.4 Client acknowledges that Contractor has appointed Deel. Inc, a Delaware registered company having its headquarters at 425 1st St, San Francisco, California, 94105, United States (**“Deel”**) as Contractor's limited payment agent for the purpose of facilitating the receipt  of  payments  made  by  Client  for  services  provided  in  connection  with  this Agreement and each Statement of Work using a payment method supported by Deel or by one  of  Deel's  Payment  Service  Providers,  and  the  disbursement  of  those  payments  to Contractor.

2.5 Client agrees to make all payments to Contractor using one of the payment methods supported  by  the  Deel  platform.  Client  and  Contractor  represent  and  warrant  that  they have carefully read, understood and accepted the Deel platform terms and conditions (the **“Deel Terms and Conditions”**) available on the Deels’ website (www.letsdeel.com/terms). In the event of any conflict between this Agreement and the Deel Terms and Conditions, this Agreement will govern. Both parties acknowledge that acceptance of the Deel Terms and Conditions by each party is a precondition to entering into this Agreement.

Client will collect and process Contractor’s Personal Data in accordance with its privacy notice and applicable laws.

3. **RELATIONSHIP OF THE PARTIES**

3.1 **Independent  Contractor.**  Contractor’s  relationship  with  Client  will  be  that  of  an independent contractor acting as a service provider to Client, and not that of an employee, worker, agent or partner of Client. Contractor will not be entitled to any statutory benefits payable to employees or workers by law, or otherwise any benefits paid or made available by  Client  to  its  employees  or  workers,  including,  without  limitation,  any  retirement  or pension  benefits,  social  security  contributions,  provident  fund  or  gratuity  payments; vacation,  holiday,  or  illness  payments;  participation  in  any  plans,  arrangements  or distributions made by Client.

3.2 **No Authority.**  Contractor  will  have  no  authority  to  enter  into  agreements  that  bind Client or create obligations on the part of Client without the prior written authorization of Client. Contractor will not hold itself out as being an employee, agent, partner or assignee of Client, as having any authority to bind Client or to incur any liability on behalf of Client, and will make such absence of authority clear in its dealings with any third parties.

3.3 **Status.**  This  Agreement  is  one  for  the  provision  of  services  as  an  independent contractor and does not create an employment relationship, and accordingly, Contractor will be solely responsible for (a) payment of all taxes, salaries, benefits, national insurance premiums,  social  security  contributions,  withholding  taxes,  workers’  compensation, unemployment  and  disability  insurance,  and  any  other  liability,  deduction,  contribution, assessment  or  claim  arising  from  or  made  in  connection  with  the  performance  of  the Services required by any government agency or any other competent authority; and (b) compliance  with  all  applicable  labor  and  employment  requirements  with  respect  to Contractor’s self-employment, sole proprietorship or other form of business organization. Contractor will report to all applicable government agencies as income all compensation received  by  Client  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  Contractor  will  ensure  that  none  of  its employees hold themselves out as being the employees of Client or having any authority at any time to bind Client, or otherwise attempt to claim any employment or other relationship with Client.

3.4 **Liability.** Contractor will be liable for and will indemnify Client and its affiliates and their directors, officers, and employees from and against all losses, liabilities, costs, (including reasonable  fees,  costs,  and  expenses  of  attorneys  and  other  professionals),  penalties, damages and expenses arising directly or indirectly from any breach of the terms of this Agreement  and/or  any  applicable  Statement  of  Work  (including  its  data  protection provisions) by Contractor or by a subcontractor engaged by Contractor of the terms of this Agreement  (including  in  relation  to  data  protection  obligations)  or  any  other  action  or inaction  by  or  for  or  on  behalf  of  Contractor  or  any  failure  to  perform  the  Services  in accordance with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, or any misrepresentations by Contractor  regarding  Contractor’s  status  and/or  the  Services  offered  or  performed  as qualifying for independent contractor status or any violation or claimed violation of a third party’s rights resulting in whole or in part from the Client’ use of the deliverables or Services of Consultant under this Agreement. Contractor will accordingly maintain in force suitable insurance policies. Contractor acknowledges that Client will not carry any liability insurance on behalf of Contractor. Contractor will provide promptly copies of such insurance obtained on reasonable request.

3.5 **Indemnification  by  Contractor.**  Contractor  will  indemnify  and  hold  Client  and  its affiliates  and  their  directors,  officers,  and  employees  harmless  from  and  against  all damages, liabilities, losses, penalties, fines, expenses and costs (including reasonable fees and  expenses  of  attorneys  and  other  professionals)  arising  out  of  or  relating  to  any obligation imposed by any government authority and/or court of law on Client to pay any withholding  taxes,  social  security,  unemployment  or  disability  insurance,  employees’ retirement  and/or  pension  benefits  or  similar  items  in  connection  with  compensation received  by  Contractor  pursuant  to  this  Agreement.  In  the  event  of  any  violation  by Contractor of applicable law related to this Section 3.5, Contractor will indemnify Client for and in respect of:

  a. payment of all taxes, salaries, benefits, national insurance premiums, social security contributions,  withholding  taxes,  workers’  compensation,  unemployment  and disability  insurance,  employees’  retirement  and/or  pension  benefits  and  any  other liability,  deduction,  contribution,  assessment  or  claim  arising  from  or  made  in connection  with  the  performance  of  the  Services  required  by  any  government agency; except where recovery by Client pursuant to this Section 3.5 is prohibited by law; and all reasonable costs, expenses, penalties, fines or interest incurred or payable by Client in connection with or in consequence of Contractor’s failure to pay any amounts due and owing to any government agency; except where Contractor’s failure to pay was caused directly by Client's negligence or intentional misconduct; and

b. any liability arising from any employment-related claim or any claim based on worker status (including reasonable fees and expenses of attorneys and other professionals) brought  by  Contractor  or  any  subcontractor  against  Client  arising  out  of  or  in connection with the provision of the Services.

3.6 **Set-off.**  Client  may,  in  its  sole  discretion,  satisfy  any  of  the  indemnities  set  forth  in Section 3.5 (in whole or in part) by way of deduction from any payments due to Contractor.

3.7 **No expectation of renewal.** Contractor agrees that they have no expectation that this Agreement will be renewed at the expiration and/or termination of the Contract Period and no  representation  regarding  the  renewal  shall  be  valid  and  binding  on  Client  unless recorded in writing and signed by authorized representatives of both Parties.
